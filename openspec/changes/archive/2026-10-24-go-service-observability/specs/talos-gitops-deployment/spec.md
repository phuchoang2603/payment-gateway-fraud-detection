## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Internal fraud-service deployment

The deployment SHALL provide internal gRPC access on port 8000 and configured OTLP metric/trace export, without an application metrics listener on port 8010 and SHALL NOT provision public ingress or TLS controllers. Liveness SHALL use the standard gRPC health service named `liveness`; readiness SHALL use `readiness` and SHALL fail once shutdown begins. The deployment SHALL NOT supply model artifacts or model configuration.

#### Scenario: Internal deployment

- **WHEN** fraud-service is deployed with either environment configuration
- **THEN** it is exposed through a ClusterIP service without model path configuration
- **AND** no public ingress, cert-manager, or Traefik resources are created

#### Scenario: Pod termination

- **WHEN** a fraud-service pod is terminating
- **THEN** readiness is withdrawn before the gRPC listener closes, while liveness remains SERVING until health checks are no longer accepted
- **AND** it stops qualifying as a ready decision endpoint

### Requirement: Shared platform ownership isolation

Synchronizing or deleting this repository's applications SHALL NOT create, adopt, or delete shared observability infrastructure, its operators, or its namespace. The application deployment SHALL NOT require CRDs or data sources from the removed observability stack and SHALL NOT install an application-owned collector, dashboard or alerting resource.

#### Scenario: Remove a payment-gateway application

- **WHEN** its application-owned resources are removed
- **THEN** the platform's telemetry collectors, store, and UI remain under the platform owner's control

#### Scenario: Render fraud deployment during the transition

- **WHEN** the dev and prod application configurations are rendered
- **THEN** neither requires resources from the removed observability stack
- **AND** the Go fraud workload exports enabled application measurements over OTLP to the shared node agent without exposing the replaced Python metrics listener


### Requirement: Gateway workload deployment

The deployment SHALL target Edge, Payments, fraud, notifier, vault simulator, processor simulator, Redis and Kafka in `payment-gateway` through the configured prod root, with ClusterIP services.

#### Scenario: Complete gateway workload deployment contract

- **WHEN** the `Gateway workload deployment` capability is configured or exercised
- **THEN** The deployment SHALL target Edge, Payments, fraud, notifier, vault simulator, processor simulator, Redis and Kafka in `payment-gateway` through the configured prod root, with ClusterIP services. One application chart and Argo CD child SHALL own the six Go services, including fraud, through a services map plus gateway CNPG, Valkey, secrets, routing and security resources; Kafka SHALL retain its separate chart and child. Fraud SHALL use the common service templates with its own Deployment and Service; no dedicated fraud chart or Argo CD child SHALL be created. Edge SHALL additionally have one Gateway API HTTPRoute on the cluster ingress gateway exposing only the hosted checkout paths `/checkout/*`, and the prod values SHALL publish that gateway host through the platform's Cloudflare ClusterTunnel `talos-proxmox` at `pay-gateway.phuchoang.sbs` so a marketplace buyer can reach the hosted page; the JSON API SHALL remain cluster-internal. It SHALL NOT restore a dev app-of-apps root. A CloudNativePG cluster owned by this repository SHALL provide separate databases and owner roles for Payments, notifier, vault and processor. Payments SHALL run migrations as its owner role and serve requests with a separate runtime role that has only `SELECT` and `INSERT` on the payment event ledger. No service's application credentials SHALL grant access to another service's database or logical replication. Application secrets SHALL come from External Secrets through the shared `fraud-doppler` ClusterSecretStore, whose namespace allow-list includes `payment-gateway` and whose bootstrap token lives in `operators`, not from the repository. Network policy SHALL default-deny vault/database/Redis access except the required callers, and SHALL allow Edge only from the ingress gateway and the namespaces of configured integrations. Redis SHALL be a standalone `Redis` resource of the platform's Redis operator (no sidecar), with bounded memory, `noeviction`, TTL-based idempotency records, a password from External Secrets and Payments-only access; Postgres remains the authoritative idempotency store. Internal gRPC SHALL be plaintext h2c secured by the Istio ambient mesh (STRICT mTLS and principal-based AuthorizationPolicy configured through the chart's `mesh.rules`), and workloads SHALL use native gRPC health probes. A repository-owned Kafka cluster, managed by the platform's Strimzi operator, SHALL run in `payment-gateway` with automatic topic creation disabled and `payments.events.v1` declared, and Kafka Connect SHALL publish only the Payments event table through dedicated CDC credentials granted by a Role scoped to that one Secret, excluding application credentials, private operation requests and vault data. Network policy SHALL admit Kafka clients only from the gateway namespace, and SHALL allow the notifier egress only to configured webhook destinations. Deleting the Kafka application SHALL NOT delete the Strimzi operator or its CRDs.

#### Scenario: Render gateway target

- **WHEN** the configured prod root is rendered
- **THEN** each workload, the database cluster, Kafka, Connect, the connector and the topic have prod-qualified identities, no dev root is created, and the only public surface is the Edge `/checkout/*` route, published through the Cloudflare tunnel

#### Scenario: Cross-database access

- **WHEN** Payments' database role attempts to read the notifier database
- **THEN** access is denied

#### Scenario: Vault database isolation

- **WHEN** Edge, Payments or processor credentials attempt to access the vault database directly
- **THEN** access is denied and only mesh-authorized vault API calls on their own port can obtain their scoped response

#### Scenario: Connector secret access

- **WHEN** the Connect service account requests a Secret other than its dedicated CDC Secret
- **THEN** access is denied

### Requirement: Production image pinning

Only after every main service image has published successfully, one CI job SHALL pin the gateway and Kafka production chart tags to that commit's `main-<full-sha>`. PR and feature-branch runs SHALL NOT update production pins. The pin commit SHALL use `[skip ci]` so its image-only production-values update does not trigger rebuilds. Manual production-values changes SHALL trigger image builds normally. No image-updater controller SHALL be required.

#### Scenario: New main image

- **WHEN** every service image for a main commit has published successfully
- **THEN** one CI job commits the same main tag to both production charts, with the gateway pin covering all six Go service images and Argo CD reconciles them

#### Scenario: PR image is newer

- **WHEN** a PR image is newer than the latest main image
- **THEN** production pins remain unchanged
