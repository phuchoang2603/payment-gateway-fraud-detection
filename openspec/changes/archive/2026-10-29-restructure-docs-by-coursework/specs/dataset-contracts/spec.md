## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Native lint and generated references

CI SHALL discover every product folder, lint each descriptor and contract with pinned Data Product CLI and Data Contract CLI, and reject drift between each contract and its generated Markdown reference under `docs/data/products/<product>/`. CI lint SHALL NOT claim to validate produced datasets.

#### Scenario: Invalid contract

- **WHEN** a contract violates the official ODCS schema
- **THEN** CI fails

#### Scenario: Stale reference

- **WHEN** a field meaning changes without regenerating its reference
- **THEN** the documentation comparison fails
